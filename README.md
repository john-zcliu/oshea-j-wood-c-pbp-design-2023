Welcome to our periplasmic binding protein biosensor design repo. Here is a description of what can be found in each directory.

## Simulations
#### Holo parameterisation
To run the holo simulations, first a PDB file was made for maltose (`mal.pdb`), from which `.mol2` and `.frcmod` files were generated using Amber:

```
antechamber -fi pdb -i MAL.pdb -fo mol2 -o mal.mol2 -c bcc -at amber
parmchk2 -i mal.mol2 -f mol2 -o mal.frcmod
```

`mal.lib` was generated in tleap (`tleap_mal.in`). The topology for the holo complex could then be generated from the 1anf crystal structure, which has been modified to decribe the maltose as a sinle residue (`crystal_bou.pdb`, `tleap_hol.in`).


#### Apo parameterisation
An apo structure was generated by removing the maltose from 1anf (`crystal_apo.pdb`). This structure was parameterised in tleap (`tleap_apo.in`)

#### Running simulations
Simulations were run using OpenMM from the respective scripts `10x200ns_apo.py` and `10x100ns_hol.py`. These generated `.dcd` output files, which are not contained in the repository.


## CONAN
To generate input for CONAN, the molecular dynamics `.dcd` output files were converted to `.xtc` using the MDTraj function "`mdconvert`". The `.xtc` files are not included in the repository.
With CONAN installed, `conan.py` was on the CONAN input files (`CONAN/conan1_X/conan1_x.inp`). The only CONAN output directory stored in the repository is "aggregate", which contains the data to generate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient plots.


## Plotting Pearson Correlation Coefficient, dDIHE, dRMSF
Code to plot these data is contained in `oshea-j-wood-c-pbp-design-2023.ipynb`. For calculating dDIHE and dRMSF of the molecular dynamics simulations, it is assumed that the `.dcd` files are contained in "`Simulations/Apo`" and "`Simulations/Holo`", but, as previously stated, these files are not included in this repository.
